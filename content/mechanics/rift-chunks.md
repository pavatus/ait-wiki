## What is a Rift Chunk?
**A rift chunk** is a tear in spacetime that can be found in any dimension. it's used to grow 
the **TARDIS Coral** or siphoned for [**Artron Energy**](../artron) that the TARDIS uses for fuel.
You can fly the TARDIS into a rift chunk to syphen fuel more efficiently (faster) or as an alternative, you can use an [**Artron Collector**](../artron#artron-collector-block) 
to collect [**Artron Energy**](../artron) while outside the TARDIS.

## How do I find a Rift Chunk?
To locate a rift chunk, you will need to craft a **Rift Scanner** with the recipe below:

![Rift Scanner Recipe](images/rift-chunks/scanner-recipe.png)

The **Rift Scanner** is a hand-held device that acts very similarly to a compass, but instead homes in on **Rift Chunks**. To locate a **Rift Chunk** using this device, simply right-click the rift scanner in your hand and follow the dial to you destination.

The device will point to the centre of the **Rift Chunk**, when you are at the centre it will spin frantically.
