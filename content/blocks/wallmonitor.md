The **Wall Monitor** is another way to change settings, customise your TARDIS and viewing TARDIS info... BUT ON YOUR WALL and giving you those groovy classic vibes!
The TARDIS Menu is included with the [**TARDIS Console**](../console) and the [Monitor](../monitor) but you can craft it as a block and can use it on your wall in your interior then just your [**Console**](../console) or [Monitor](../monitor).

## Customizing your TARDIS
In the monitor you can customise your TARDIS like the Exterior, Interior and the Hum. For how to change it is said in [**Customizing your TARDIS**](../../mechanics/customizing) page.

## TARDIS Information
When looking at the right side of the monitor it will display a few things, on the top will display where your **TARDIS** is with the coordinates, dimension and where it's facing too. Next in the middle will display how long your flight is with a progress bar. Then on the bottom will display where is your target destination will be like the **coordinates display** and also on the bottom left is the [**Artron Energy**](../../mechanics/artron) bar that shows how much energy you have in your **TARDIS**.
